<p>Bboy Graphicxz,
From Johannesburg , South Africa,
They also call me Tich, been breaking since 2004,
Got in for the powermoves , stayed for the memories, started in High school and with the move to
broadband internet and creation of youtube , had to 1 day visit Korea.
Felt like when you've come so far and still so far to go.
Breaking has been a really rewarding challenge daily and a sense of identiy and outlet just to do
whatever I want, which is something you don't get a let of , valuable and not to be lost.
With how it's something that you can do almost anywhere but not something you get just
anywhere.
My local crew in South Africa, Roxolid linked up at Witwatersrand University, all similar minded
peeps who don't smoke or drink but tear it up on the dancefloor.
Moved to Deok so GyeonggiÂ­do and been in Seoul Seekers since 2011 even after moving back to
Johannesburg South Africa , also pushing the O.U.R. system for the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
